# NoteApp

**Highlight**:  
- Using [Material Design][0] 🌈
- Local Database [SQL Server][1]
- MVVM architecture

**Note**:
- This is my second WPF App 
- It will be added with other features later (such as Login, Cloud Database, better UI Design, ...)

Do you know who I am referring to in this app?   
[Severus Snape][2]🦉🐦
